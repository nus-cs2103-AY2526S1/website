Good to see that lecture briefings are generally well-received. 
Also keep in mind that they are meant to be 'briefings' only -- as the learning the full content is expected to be
done at your own pace, using the textbook and the pre-recorded videos.

I'll continue to improve the existing ones and add more videos.

The feedback for the course website is generally positive but I'm sure there are areas to improve.
  I will continue to try and improve the website whenever I can.<br>
  In the meantime, I thank you for your patience with the website -- it's not easy to disseminate that much
  of information in a way that fits everyone's expectations %%(e.g., some prefer more content to be more 'visual'
  while others prefer minimalistic presentation)%%,
  and we realize that ==it is not easy for you to consume that much of information== either. 
  If you can't seem to find the information you are looking for in the website, just ask (post in the forum
   of email tic2002@comp.nus.edu.sg).

Good to see that the workload is manageable to almost all who responded, 
 but I realize it may not be the case for a few among those who did not respond.

* **If the workload is higher than you can manage:** This course can feel heavy, 
  especially if you don't have prior programming
  experience, and also if you have a day job too.<br>
  That said, SE courses are usually heavy because learning SE skills needs a lot of practice.<br>
  I try to alleviate the workload problem by keeping deadlines fairly flexible and maintaining a low bar for
  the minimum you need to do to get a decent grade. 
* **If you have room for more work:**
  * Try to do more in the project: The project is open ended are you are encouraged to do as much as you want.
    You can refer to [Duke full description](https://nus-tic2002-ay2526s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html) to find
    more things you can do with it.
  * Learn the optional topics: I have added a lot more optional topics to the second half of the semester.
    This means there is more to learn every week, if you have the capacity to do so.

Good to see that the pace is mostly manageable for most too.
* **If the pace is faster than you can manage:** Not to worry; thanks to the iterative approach we use for
  covering topics, you'll get multiple chances to solidify your familiarity of a topic/tool.
  Do what you can every week and ==try not to fall too far behind== though.
* **If the pace is too slow for you:** I have add more optional topics to the second half of the semester,
  and made all pre-recorded videos for future lectures available.
   This means you should be able to move faster through the weeks if you wish.

<markdown>maybe release handout for the week before lecture not after</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>The proper 'handout' is the weekly textbook topics, which we release in advance-- it's the 'Topics' page of the weekly schedule in the course website ([example](https://nus-tic2002-ay2526s1.github.io/website/schedule/week6/topics.html)). Slides are not meant to be documents to print and study for exams (the textbook is the resource more suitable for exam prep). Their purpose is to support the briefing delivery and keep you engaged during the briefing. That's why our slides are less detailed and more visual.</markdown>

<markdown>The material is very detailed and very useful. I love the website. However, it maybe a bit too much to read. It would be really helpful for me if I could know which parts I can skip or focus less on.</markdown>

<box type="info" icon=":fas-comment:" light><span class="text-info"><markdown>Indeed, the course website can be overwhelming at times. The [topic levels system](https://nus-tic2002-ay2526s1.github.io/website/admin/index.html#:~:text=the-,topic%20levels%20system,-indicates%20the%20progression) can be used to decide which topics are more important than others. For example, level-4 topics are non-examinable and can be skipped.</markdown>
