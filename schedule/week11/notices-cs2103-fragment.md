Due to holidays, **this week's tutorial is released as a pre-recorded video**.

What you need to do:

1. Have a look at the three tutorial tasks given below in this page. It's best if you attempt them first, before you start watching the video.
1. Watch the video, and do the tasks as the video instructs you %%(e.g., answer in-video questions, post screenshots in workspace file)%%.
1. If you have doubts or questions, post in your tutorials MSTeam channel (and tag the tutor), or post in the course forum.

**:fas-clock: Period to watch the video** (to be ==counted for tutorial participation==): {{ get_date(date_w10_start, 1, time="")}} -- <span class="text-danger">{{ get_date(date_w10_start, 7, time="23:59")}}</span>

<box type="info" header="****This Friday's briefing (and the PE Dry Run)****">

Heads up! ==Attendance is compulsory== for the weekly briefing coming up on {{ get_date(date_w11_start, 4, time='') }}, as we use that time slot for the [Practical Exam Dry Run](../../admin/tp-ped.md) (<span class="text-danger">graded</span>) -- but you finish the PE-D by 4pm, you need not attend the briefing live (you can watch the recording later).
