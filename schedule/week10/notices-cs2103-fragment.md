##### **Adjustments due to the long weekend this week...**

* **Week 10 quiz (on Canvas)**: The deadline has been extended till Week 11 Tuesday 16:00 (i.e., four extra days). No change to the early submission deadline.
* **Week 10 tutorial**: Released as a pre-recorded video. See the [Tutorial page](tutorial.md) for more details. To be watched by Week 11 Tuesday, but recommended to watch around/before your normal tutorial slot timing.
* **Week 10â†’11 briefing**: Will be done at the usual time, but Zoom only (i.e., no F2F option). As usual, you can join the Zoom meeting live or watch the recording later.
* **Other tP/admin deadlines** will remain as before. If the deadline falls within the holiday period, you are recommended to finish the task early (i.e., before the holiday), but you can also do them _after_ the holidays if the deadline is flexible %%(e.g., weekly tP tasks)%%, or during the holiday period itself (if you prefer to stick with your regular weekly schedule).
