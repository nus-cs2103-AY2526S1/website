<div tags="m--cs2113">

* We will use Examplify for the final exam.
* The exam is **closed-book** (i.e., secure exam).
* However, the course textbook (pdf version) and UML reference sheet will be made available to you via the exam attachment.
* Permitted materials:<br>
  1 A4 sized cheat sheet.<br>
  NUS-approved calculator.

## Exam structure

The exam duration is 90 minutes.

The final exam has two types of questions:
1. MCQ questions - includes True/False like concept questions and some multiple choice/response questions
2. Short-answer questions

<br>

* All questions will be displayed at once as Examplify doesn't allow creating sections
* Based on the question you are answering, you need to manage your time appropriately
* Weightage of the questions will be displayed to help you with time management


## Exam briefing, mock exam, practice exam paper

* Please watch the [Examplify briefing video here](https://mediaweb.ap.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=48df9509-7daf-41f4-9ee8-ae22008a7383)
* [Examplify briefing slides](https://nus.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAstudent/pages/22511667/Examplify+Student+Briefing+Slides); look for In-Person Assessment
* You will be given a practice exam paper (smaller than the full paper) to help you practice timing. That practice paper will be released at least one week before the exam.

## Exam admin info to note

1. **Schedule/venue:** The final exam will be as per the normal exam schedule, which will be sent to you by the Registrar's Office (or you can find via EduRec -> Academics -> Exams -> View exam schedule). You can find the date/time from [NUSMODS](https://nusmods.com/modules/{{ course }}) as well.
1. **Scope:**
   * All topics in the textbook, excluding level 4 topics (i.e., optional topics), are examinable. For your convenience, you can view the examinable portion of the textbook in [this printable view of the textbook](../se-book-adapted/print.html).
   * In addition, you are expected to be aware of SE-related things (i.e., tools, techniques, concepts) encountered while doing the iP and the tP %%e.g., Was testing technique X used in the tP?%%.<br>
     That is, you are expected to strengthen your SE _knowledge_ (not just hands-on skills) as you do the course projects -- in particular, to be able to connect theory to practice.
1. **Mode: F2F, using Examplify**. You ==need to **bring your own device**== (<span class="text-danger">iPads not suitable</span>), which can connect to the NUS Wi-Fi network.<br>
  Please use these resources if you haven't used Examplify in the recent past (the behavior may be different from the version you used last semester):
   * See [NUS Guides on Examplify](https://nus.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DAstudent/overview).
   * Try a few practice exams provided in the above link.
   * Write to NUS CIT (citbox25@nus.edu.sg) if you run into any technical issues.
   * If you do not have a working laptop for the exam, please contact IT Care itcare@nus.edu.sg directly for a laptop loan (for exam purpose only).
1. ==**Examplify will use the {{ 'full' if is_full_lockdown else '~~full~~ simulated' }} lock-down**== mode during the exam i.e., no access Internet, and,
   {{ 'no' if is_full_lockdown else 'not allowed to' }} access any applications/files on your computer during the exam {{ '==except the _Exam Reference_ PDF file==' if not is_full_lockdown }}.<br>
   %%Reason: Because of the risk of locally-installed LLMs affecting the integrity of the exam, NUS recommends using full-lockdown mode.%%
1. **This is a 'cheatsheet' exam**: **You are allowed the usual one A4 size cheatsheet** (both sides). There is no restriction on what it can contain.<br>
   In addition,
   * **[this exam-reference-sheet](exam-reference-sheet.html) will be made available inside Examplify**, as an exam-wide PDF file attachment.
   * **Java and Git coding standards will be given as question-specific attachments**, if the question is related to either of them.
1. **==You need to check the exam-compatibility of your device early==** (as given in the panel below) -- even if you have used Examplify for other exams before, as the Examplify behaviour varies based on the specific exam configuration -- and work with NUS CIT to resolve any issues you encounter.{% if is_full_lockdown %}<br>
   Issues encountered by past students include problems in viewing and searching the _exam reference_ PDF file inside Examplify.{% endif %}

<div class="indented-level1">

<panel type="info" header="**How to check the compatibility of your device**" expanded>

* **Ensure you have Examplify installed**{.text-info} in your exam device. {texts="['i.', 'ii.', 'iii.', 'iv.', 'v.']" t-class="fw-bold text-info"}{% if not is_full_lockdown %}
* **:fab-windows:/:fab-linux: Windows/Linux users: Ensure you have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed**{.text-info} in your exam device -- no other PDF software allowed during the exam.<br>
  :fab-apple: Mac users: You may use the Preview app that comes with macOS or the Adobe Acrobat Reader.<br>
  :fab-windows: Windows users: When downloading the Adobe Acrobat installer, you may want to opt out of installing additional bundled
   software (e.g., McAfee Virus Scanner) -- this option is given when downloading, not when installing.{% endif %}

* **Download the mock exam**{.text-info} we have provided. It has only three dummy questions, for you to get familiar with the exam mode.
* **Do the mock exam**{.text-info} (password: `Hello123`).<br>
  **Confirm you are able to open/resize/navigate{% if is_full_lockdown %}/search{% endif %} the PDF file**{.text-info} we have provided as an attachment inside Examplify (this file can be accessed via the `EXAM CONTROLS` menu in the Examplify UI).{% if is_full_lockdown %}{% else %}In the mock exam, this PDF file contains just a single page with some dummy content.{% endif %}

Deadline to complete the compatibility check (including liaising with CIT): #r#at least 10 days before the exam##

</panel>
<p/>
</div>

7. **You are not required to record the screen**. Doing so can cause problems (lag, crashes, lockout etc.).
1. **Download all parts of the exam before you come to the exam** (i.e., parts 1, 2). We'll give you the password for opening each part at the exam, at the starting time of each part.<br>
  You will be notified when they are ready for download (typically, around 24 hours before the exam start time).
1. **If you have a doubt/query about a question**, or want to make an assumption about a question, please write it down in the 'NOTES' text box. ==Do not try to communicate those with the invigilator during the exam.== %%(reason: at an exam of this scale, it is not practical to clarify such doubts on-the-spot on a timely manner)%%. We'll take your doubt/query/assumption into account when grading. For example, if many had queries about a specific question, we can conclude that the question is unclear and omit it from grading.

<include src="exam-doubts-fragment.md" />

9. **Bring your computer fully charged**, although some charging points will be available at the exam venue (so, bring the charger too).<br>
   {{ icon_important_big_red }} **NUS does not allow local LLMs in the exam device.** Please uninstall such tools before the exam.

{{ show_faq("examSitNearChargingPoint") }}

10. **You must start the exam within 5 minutes of receiving the password**.


## Structure/format

<div tags="m--cs2103">

* The exam has 2 parts.
* Although the official duration of the exam is 1.5 hours, note that the actual exam might take up to 2 hours (due to technical issues). So, please don't schedule anything important right after the exam.

### Final exam - part 1

* You will be asked to draw some UML diagrams, **to be hand-drawn on paper** (not on a tablet).<br>
  You may use pencils if you wish.
* Duration: 20 minutes
* The questions will be in Examplify.
* **Bring 1-2 sheets of A4 size papers when you come to the exam**, for drawing these diagrams.
* These diagrams will not be graded directly. Instead, you will use them when answering part 2 of the exam.<br>
  However, we may use the diagrams to give _some_ consolation marks should you score very low in the corresponding MCQ questions.<br>
  For that purpose, the papers will be collected at the end of the full exam (i.e., after part 2 is over).
</div>
<div tags="m--cs2103">

### Final exam - part 2

* A quiz containing 32 MCQ questions. All questions are estimated to be equal size/difficulty.
* You only need to answer 30 questions correctly to get full marks. The extra two questions are a cushion against careless mistakes or misinterpreting a question.
* Questions will appear in random order.
* You #r#will not be able to go back to previous questions##.<br>

{{ show_faq("examWhyNoBackwardNavigation") }}

* Duration: **70 minutes** <span tags="m--cs2103">(recommended: allocate 2 minutes per question, which gives you a 6-minute buffer)</span>
* Most MCQ question have a short-answer follow-up question.
* Given below is an example question. The answer is `a` and the answer to the follow-up question can be `OOP is only one of the choices for an SE project`.
<div class="indented-level2">

<panel header="Sample question 1" expanded >

* **Some Part 2 questions will be based on the UML diagrams you drew in Part 1**. In case you need to refer back to Part 1 questions, they will be provided as a PDF attachment in Part 2.
* **Diagrams/images in some questions will be repeated as an attachment** for some questions, so that you can see the top part and bottom part of the question side-by-side, rather than repeatedly scrolling up-and-down. You can close the attachment pane (using the `Close Toolkit` button) if it is getting in your way. An example is given below.
