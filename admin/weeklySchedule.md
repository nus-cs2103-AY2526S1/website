### Timing of the {{ lecture_name }}

As our lecture slot (which we use for the weekly briefing) is on {{ day_lecture }} (i.e., at the end of the week), ==the briefing in Week~n~ lecture slot covers a recap of Week~n~ and a preview of Week~n+1~== %%e.g., The briefing on week 3 {{ day_lecture }} covers a recap of week 3 and a preview of week 4%%.

### Deadline for weekly tasks

<span class="text-danger">**The deadline** for weekly tasks is {{ day_lecture }} {{ time_lecture_start}}</span> i.e.,the lecture slot start time. Work done after that time %%(e.g., code committed after {{ day_lecture }} {{ time_lecture_start}})%% will be credited for the following week.

{% if not cs2113 %}**It's OK to miss a few weekly project deadlines occasionally** i.e., we'll not penalize you even if you occasionally miss those deadlines, as long as you catch up soon enough (within a few days after the deadline). This flexibility does not apply if a task description states a specific deadline.<br>
{% endif %}

**It's OK to make occasional mistakes in weekly tasks** (making mistakes is a natural part of learning new things after all). If a weekly task was not accepted as 'done' due to a mistake you made, go ahead and rectify the mistake as soon as you can -- in most cases, our grading scripts will not penalize such mistakes if they are corrected soon after.

**We won't wait forever though.** Note that for most interim deliverables, we stop checking about one week after the deadline is over. So, work/corrections done more than one week after the deadline might not get noticed at all by our grading scripts, even as late submissions.
</div>

### Timing recommendations

* **Start Week~n+1~ tasks on Week~n~ Friday**. As the Week~n+1~ briefing is done on Week~n~ Friday (i.e., ~2 days before the week actually starts), you are recommended to start on Week~n~ tasks on that Friday itself. That way, you have more time to finish them by the Week~n+1~ deadline (i.e., Week~n+1~ {{ day_lecture }} {{ time_lecture_start}}).{{ bullet_checkbox_selected_green }}
* <span id="before-attempting-tasks">**Before attempting weekly project tasks, go through the weekly topics**{% if not cs2103 %} (and do the weekly programming exercises/activities, if any){% endif %} as the knowledge from those topics may be needed to complete the project tasks.</span>
* **Try to finish most weekly tasks before attending the tutorial of that week**, because some tutorial tasks are done best _after_ weekly tasks have been completed, for the best learning experience.
