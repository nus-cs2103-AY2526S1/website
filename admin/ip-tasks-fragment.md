##### iP feels like 'same same' ...?{.text-success}

**As you do the iP, if you feel like you are not learning enough new stuff** as you've done similar work before (at least on the Java/OOP side), there is an alternative approach you can take to the iP. See the panel below if you are interested.

<panel type="seamless" header="****iP.AI****: an AI-assisted approach to the iP" minimized>

**Goal**: In the iP.AI approach, your goal is to minimize hand-coding the iP, by getting generative AI tools (such as Co-Pilot) to write the code for you instead. The learning goal is to explore how to increase your coding productivity using AI tools.

**Requirements:**

1. You should follow the normal iP requirements/deadlines, except that you will try to replace handcoding with AI-assisted code generation, where possible. It is still fine to do some of the coding work manually.
1. You may use any free or commercial AI tools, provided you declare which tool you used (how to declare? see next point).
1. Add a file named `AI.md` at the root of project folder (same location where `CONTRIBUTORS.md` lives). Commit the file. Keep it updated with a record of your use of AI tools (e.g., which tool you used for which increment), and interesting observations (e.g., what worked? what didn't? overall, how much time did it save?). You can update this file periodically (e.g., once a week). The content format can be plaintext or Markdown. It need not be very detailed (e.g., even a 0.5 page is enough).

**Caveat:** This alternative does not earn you extra credit, but it gives you an opportunity to learn more about AI tools related to SE, with the same (or even less) effort.<br>
This alternative is only suitable for those who are already good at hand-coding. Reason: At the current state of the art of AI tools, only those who are already good at hand-coding can use those tools to increase productivity. So, you must become good at hand-coding before you venture into using AI tools for coding.

If you are new to Git branching, before attempting this iP increment, first learn Git branching from [this week's textbook topics]({{ baseUrl }}/schedule/week3/topics.html). In particular, learn how to merge a branch without fast forwarding.
</box>

* **Do Level 7 in a branch named `branch-Level-7`**. Here are the steps:
  1. Start a branch `branch-Level-7`.
  1. Implement Level 7 while committing to that branch at appropriate points,
  1. Merge the branch back to the `master` branch (remember to create a merge commit i.e., ==no fast-forward==).
  1. Git tag the merge commit in the `master` branch as usual (i.e., add the tag `Level-7`).
  1. Push the following three things to your fork:<br>
     (a) the `master` branch,<br>
     (b) the `branch-Level-7` branch,<br>
     (c) the `Level-7` tag.<br>
     {{ icon_important_big_red }} Advanced git users: do not delete the branch after merging.<br>
     {{ icon_important_big_red }} Only _merged_ branches are detected by the script. After merging a branch `b1` to the `master` branch, you need to push both the `master` and the `b1` branches to the fork. Pushing the `master` branch does not automatically take the `b1` branch along with it just because it is already merged to the `master` branch.

As you know, one main goal of the iP is to prepare for you for the tP. The task below is heavy on the 'training for tP' aspect.

In previous iP increments, you learned:

* How to merge branches locally and push to your fork
* How to create PRs from the `master` branch to an upstream repo

In the following iP task you will learn how to do the following new things, which are relevant to the tP:

* How to merge branches remotely, and pull to your local repo
* How to create PRs from branches other than `master`
* How to manage PRs that your repo receive
* How to work with parallel PRs

Due to the above learning goals, this iP task is a bit complicated. Pay attention and try to achieve all learning goals along the way.
{% endcall %}
<br/>

* **Note how to merge PRs**:

{{ embed_topic("../book/gitAndGithub/managePRs/text.md#body", "Textbook " + icon_embedding + " Git & GitHub → **Merging PRs**", "1", indent=1) }}

* **Practice using parallel git branches _and_ PRs**, as explained below:
1. First, do each increment as a parallel branch (follow the branch naming convention you followed earlier `branch-Level-8` etc.), but do not merge any.
   <mermaid>
   {{ "%%{init: { 'theme': 'default', 'gitGraph': {'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%" }}
   gitGraph
   commit id: "m1"
   commit id: "m2"
   branch branch-A-Assertions
   checkout branch-A-Assertions
   commit id: "b1c1"
   checkout master
   branch branch-A-CodeQuality
   checkout branch-A-CodeQuality
   commit id: "b2c1"
   checkout master
   branch branch-A-Streams
   checkout branch-A-Streams
   commit id: "b3c1"
   commit id: "b3c2"
   checkout master
   </mermaid>

1. Then, push each branch to your fork, and create a PR !!within your fork!! (i.e., from the increment branch to the `master` branch). ==Be careful not to create a PR to [the upstream repo]({{ url_course_org }}/ip).== %%If you did create such a PR by mistake, no worries, just close it yourself.%%

{{ embed_topic("../book/gitAndGithub/createPRs/text.md#body", "Textbook " + icon_embedding + " Git & GitHub → **Creating PRs**", "1", indent=1) }}

<box type="tip" seamless>

When you are doing the next step, you can run into merge conflicts. In some cases, GitHub will give you a way to resolve those conflicts using the Web interface. While this approach may be good enough for simple merge conflicts, **de-conflicting locally in the standard way is safer** (e.g., you can run tests to confirm the updated code is correct) and more standard (it's a standard Git feature that you can use even when you are not using GitHub for your project).
</box>

3. Now, merge one of the PRs and update the remaining PRs accordingly, as given below:
   * Merge one of the PRs on GitHub. Remember to choose the `Create merge commit` option when merging.{ texts="['3.1)','3.2)','3.3)','3.4)','3.5)']" }
   * The above step will cause the `master` branch of your local repo to fall behind that of your fork (<popover content="because your remote `master` branch (i.e., `origin/master`) now has a merge commit that the local `master` does not have yet">why</popover>). Therefore, you need to sync the local `master` with the remote `master` branch. One way to do that is to switch to the local `master` branch and then pull the updated `master` branch from your fork e.g.,
      ```{.no-line-numbers}
      $ git checkout master
      $ git pull origin master
      ```
   Tag the merge commit as usual, and push to the fork.<br>
   The diagram below shows the current situation, assuming you merged the `A-Assertions` PR first.
   <mermaid>
   {{ "%%{init: { 'theme': 'default', 'gitGraph': {'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%" }}
   gitGraph
   commit id: "m1"

   branch branch-A-CodeQuality
   checkout branch-A-CodeQuality
   commit id: "b2c1"
   checkout master
   branch branch-A-Streams

   commit id: "b3c1"
   commit id: "b3c2"
   checkout master
   merge branch-A-Assertions tag: "A-Assertions"
   </mermaid>
   * Note how the remaining <tooltip content="i.e., branches not merged to the `master` branch yet">un-merged branches</tooltip> are no longer in sync with the latest `master`. To rectify, merge the `master` branch on to each of them. Resolve merge conflicts, if any. The outcome will be something like the below:{ texts="['3.3)']" }
   <mermaid>
   {{ "%%{init: { 'theme': 'default', 'gitGraph': {'mainBranchName': 'master'}} }%%" }}

   checkout branch-A-CodeQuality
   merge master id: "merge master to ..."
   checkout branch-A-Streams
   merge master
   </mermaid>
   * Push the updated branches to your fork. The PRs will update automatically to reflect the updated branch.{ texts="['3.4)','3.5)']" }
   * As before, tag the merge commit in the master branch and push the tag to your fork.
1. Merge the remaining PRs using a procedure similar to the above. The diagram below shows the situation after merging the `A-CodeQuality` PR and syncing the local `branch-A-Streams` with the updated `master` branch.

One of the iP increments asks you to push the design more towards the OOP approach. This is a good point to remind you the following points:

****Good OOP != OOP is good****: While the course pushes you to use _good OOP_, do not interpret it as a message of _OOP is good_; it's good for many situations but not so for some other situations. The best is usually a combination of approaches. Hence, you are encouraged to get better at other paradigms, the _functional_ paradigm in particular which has been rising in popularity in some areas such as big data, AI, parallel systems.<br>
That said, it is also preferable to use one paradigm as the primary approach and fallback on others only when the primary paradigm is clearly sub-optimal. Reason: mixing everything in equal measures might make the system even harder to understand.

**OOP is primary paradigm for this course and you are expected to try to push it to its limits.** That should give you a first-hand experience of OOP's strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, OOP (or any other paradigm) will appear worse than it really is if not used correctly, and learning to use it correctly in increasingly larger systems is another objective you can aim for in this course. {% if cs2103 %}As you do the tP later, you'll also realize that while OOP is used for the internal design of its components, the higher-level design is not specifically an OOP one.{% endif %}<br>

**We do not prohibit the use of other paradigms**, however. For example, if you find a place where the _functional_ approach is better, go ahead and use it. As you know, Java supports functional programming to a certain extent. {% if cs2103 %}In fact, the tP code given to you uses small snippets of functional-style code in several places.{% endif %}

1. **Fork** [{{ url_course_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }}]({{ url_course_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }}), while noting the points below:<br>
   <box type="important" seamless><md>==**Keep the fork name as `{{ ip_repo_name }}`**== or else our grading scripts will not be able to detect it. You can change the fork name to something else after the semester (and the grading) is over e.g., after receiving your grade for the course.</md></box>
   <box type="tip" seamless><md>**Untick the `[ ] Copy the master branch only` option** so that you get a copy of the full repo.</md></box>
1. ==**Enable the issue tracker** of your fork== (Go to `Settings` of your fork, scroll to the `Features` section, and tick the `Issues` checkbox). %%Reason: at times we post feedback on your issue tracker.%%<br>
   <box type="tip" seamless><md> If the issue tracker is enabled, you should be able to visit the following URL `https://github.com/{your_user_name}/{{ ip_repo_name }}/issues/new`<br> e.g., `https://github.com/johnDoe/{{ ip_repo_name }}/issues/new`</md></box>
1. **Clone the fork** onto your computer.
   <box type="warning" seamless><md>**Avoid putting Git-controlled files inside cloud-synced (e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox) folders.** Reason: Multiple tools trying to detect/sync changes in the same folder can cause conflicts and unexpected behaviors.<br> If you want to access project files from multiple computers, use Git to do that (rather than cloud syncing tools).</md></box>
1. **Set up the project in your IDE** as explained in [the README file]({{ url_course_org }}/{{ ip_repo_name }}/blob/master/README.md), if you plan to use an IDE for the project.
   <box type="tip" seamless><md>**Not willing to lose Vim power?** Vim users worried about losing access to powerful Vim features if you use an IDE for the project: Most IDEs have a Vim plugin (e.g., [IdeaVim plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim)) for using Vim features within the IDE i.e, it is possible to access both IDE features and Vim features at the same time!</md></box>

##### DukePro

> “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” – David Allen ([source](https://dansilvestre.com/productivity-quotes))

DukePro frees your mind of having to remember things you need to do. It's,
* text-based
* easy to learn
* ~~FAST~~ _SUPER_ FAST to use

All you need to do is,
1. download it from [here]().
1. double-click it.
1. add your tasks.
1. let it manage your tasks for you :wink:

And it is **FREE**!

Features:
- [x] Managing tasks
- [ ] Managing deadlines (coming soon)
- [ ] Reminders (coming soon)

---

If you are a Java programmer, you can use it to practice Java too. Here's the `main` method:
```java{.no-line-numbers}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Application.launch(MainApp.class, args);
    }
}
```

   * Create the JAR file {% if cs2103%}[using Gradle](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html) -- this needs to be a [fat JAR file](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jar.html#fat-jar-files:~:text=given%20here.-,Fat%20JAR%20files,-A%20normal%20JAR) (hence, it's best created [using Gradle's shadow plugin](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jar.html#:~:text=Creating-,JAR%20files,With%20Gradle,-With%20IntelliJ%20IDEA)).{% else %}in one of these ways:
     * If you have added a GUI or using third-party libraries: [use Gradle](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html).
     * Else: you can use IntelliJ.{% endif %}
   * The JAR file should be ==cross-platform and should work in a computer that has Java 17==. To avoid version compatibility issues, we strongly recommend the following approach:
      1. Open a terminal window, and navigate to the root of your project folder.
      1. Run the `java -version` command to confirm the terminal is using Java 17.
      1. Run the `./gradlew clean shadowJar` command to create the JAR file.
3. **Do the following [_smoke tests_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_testing_(software))** to ensure the jar file works %%(reason: a similar flow will be used when grading your iP)%%.<br>
   1. Copy the jar file to an empty folder and test it from there. This should surface issues with hard-coded file paths.<br>
      When running the jar file for smoke testing, instead of double-clicking the jar file, do the following: open a terminal -> navigate to the jar location -> run the `java -jar "JAR_FILE_NAME"` command.
   1. Pass the jar file to team members and ask them to do a test drive. Assuming some of your team members' OS differ from yours, this should verify if the app is cross-platform.<br>
      {{ icon_tip }} If you don't have ready access to a specific OS, you can ask others' help to smoke-test it by [posting a smoke-testing request in the forum]({{ url_forum }}/new?template=smoke.md) -- some of them will even appreciate the opportunity to help a classmate.<br>
     {{ icon_info }} Note that concepts you encounter while doing course project tasks (e.g., _smoke testing_) are in the [scope of the final exam](exams.html#:~:text=you%20are%20expected%20to%20be%20aware%20of%20SE%2Drelated%20things%20(i.e.%2C%20tools%2C%20techniques%2C%20concepts)%20encountered%20while%20dong%20the%20iP%20and%20the%20tP).
4. **Create a new release on GitHub** (e.g., `v0.2`) and upload the JAR file.
   * Recommended to refrain from uploading multiple JAR files as this can cause extra work for the evaluators.

**If you wish to cite the iP in your resume**, you can do more to make it look more impressive to a potential employer. These improvements are not considered for grading and can be done after the semester is over. Some ideas:
* **Improve the GUI**: Make the UI look nicer, unique, and memorable. You can get inspiration from [what others have done](ip-showcase.html) (but remember to give credit if you reuse any code from them).
* **Add a demo** video or an animated gif to your user guide to show how the app works.
* **Improve code quality**: iP is the right size to cite as an example of your code quality. You can use the RepoSense link (<span class="badge rounded-pill bg-light text-dark text-monospace">**&lt;/>**</span>) in the [iP showcase page](ip-showcase.html) to point to your iP code.
* **Add more features.**

{{ icon_tip }} On a somewhat related note, you can also **create similar product websites for your other projects** (projects from other courses, pet projects).

<span id="heading_add_an_extension">Add an extension</span>
<div id="desc_add_an_extension">

* Add at least one extension of your choice, selected from [category B, C, or D](../se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html#extensions-category-b) i.e., pick just one item from one category (i.e., one extension in total, not one from _each_ category) e.g., `B-DoWithinPeriodTasks` or `C-Sort` or `D-Places`
* Recommended to add the extension via a branch (branch name is up to you). Optional to add it via a PR.
* Add a ==tag named `BCD-Extension`== to the corresponding commit.<br>
Irrespective of the exact extension you did, the tag name should be `BCD-Extension`.

<div class="indented-level2">

{{ icon_important_big_red }} Discuss with your team members to ensure that each member picks a different extension.


{{ icon_tip }} You may want to pick an extension that is potentially relevant to your tP so that the code can be reused in the tP later, if possible.
