# Course overview
<div class="indented" id="course-info">

<pic eager src="{{baseUrl}}/images/growingPlant.png" width="700"></pic>

_{{ course_pair }} Introduction to Software Engineering_ contains roughly a **50-50 balance of theory and practice** of SE. It covers the knowledge/skills necessary to do small software projects, and as such, it is **a first step towards preparing you to work in bigger SE projects**, which will be done in later courses.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**This course is optimized for SCALE students**{.text-success} so that you can _learn at your own pace_ even if you are not a full-time student: the need to attend lectures/tutorials at fixed times is low, deadlines are more flexible than usual, and the on-campus presence is optional.

e.g., **Instead of traditional instructor-led tutorials**, the course provides quizzes and other activities that you can do at your own time to self-test your knowledge. The instructor can be consulted if you need help with any of them.

**[Note for TCX3221 students]**{.text-info} Sometimes, TIC2002 course code is used to refer to this course (instead of the longer {{ course_pair }}). **There is no difference between TIC2002 and TCX3221 -- so, whatever is stated for TIC2002 applies to TCX3221 as well**.

# Lectures + Tutorials
<div class="indented" id="lectures-info">

%%:far-clock:%% {{ "Tuesday" if S == '1' else "Wednesday" }} 6.30-9.30pm<br>
%%:fas-map-marker-alt:%% {{ lecture_venue }}<br>

**==The first lecture will be in F2F mode==, and will start at 7pm.**

**Subsequent lecture + tutorial time is divided into three parts, as given below and will be in hybrid mode.**<br>
You can continue to attend them using F2F mode but those who show good progress in weekly tasks will have the option to join live via Zoom, or watch the recording later.

* **[6.30-7.00pm] Pre-lecture consultations:**
  * You can use this time to get prof's help if you encountered problems while doing the previous week's tasks.
  * This session will be online. Communications with the prof is to be done using Microsoft Teams app.
    * If the question is potentially relevant to others in the class, post your question in the chat room of the `TIC2002-{{ period }}` ([link]({{ url_ms_teams_class }})) MS Team.
    * Otherwise search for prof's name (`Damith Chatura RAJAPAKSE`) in MS Teams and send a private chat message.
* **[7.00-8.00pm] Lecture briefing**:
  * Will be done in Hybrid mode (i.e., you can attend F2F, or join via Zoom, or watch the recording later).
* **[8.00-9.30pm] Post-lecture consultations**:
  * This portion will start as soon as the previous portion  (i.e., the _lecture briefing_) ends.
  * During this time,
    * go through the week's lecture topics in the course website
    * do suggested activities/exercises in there (if any)
    * if you encounter any problems while doing the above or have a question, contact the prof/TA using MS-Teams or F2F.

**Lecture slides are not suitable to be used as reference materials** as they have been <tooltip content="i.e., heavy use of graphics and animations">optimized for lecture delivery</tooltip> instead. Use the textbook (not slides) as your main reference. Slides can be uploaded to Canvas if requested, _after_ the lecture.<br>

{{ line_dotted }}<!-- ................................................................................... -->

# Programming language
<div class="indented" id="java">

This course uses Java. It assumes you are familiar with C++ basics and provides lessons to help you transition from C++ to Java.

{{ icon_important_big_red }} Install [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) on your computer. Using other versions of Java is highly discouraged.

</div>

{{ line_dotted }}<!-- ................................................................................... -->

# Programming exercises
<div id="exercises-info" class="indented">

In some weeks, there will be some programming exercises for you to submit (on Coursemology). You should do the exercises as you learn the topics.


<box type="warning" seamless>

==**Focus on learning the topic rather than finishing the exercises.**== While these are exercises provided to self-test your knowledge, the more important thing is to read and understand the topic content. Furthermore, not all topics are tested by exercises.
</box>

{{ icon_important_big_red }} Programming exercises are graded for participation.

**FAQ: Which code editor to use when doing programming exercises?**<br>
**Answer:** Here are some options:

* Later in the course, we will be using [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as our code editor. If you are already familiar with using similar editors (e.g., VS Code), you can start using it early. The community edition (free) is good enough for this course.
* If you are familiar with another code editor that supports Java (e.g., VS Code), you can use that.
* For the time being, you can use an online code editor such as repl.it (create an account -> sign in -> click on `+ Create Repl` -> choose Java).
* You can use a simple text editor, compile using `javac` command, and run using `java` command.
</div>

# Project
<div class="indented">

<div  id="project-info">

* The project is to be done **individually**.
* The project based on a [generic project called Duke](../se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html).
* In the project, you will build a small chatbot, using Java.
* The project is to be done in small increments. You will be given a schedule of what increments to be done in each week.
* Some weekly increments will be common to all students, while some will vary from student to student. That means your final product will be unique in terms of total features, but some features will be common to other students in the class.

</div>

Weekly project increments are given in the panels below:
<div class="indented">
{% for i in range(3, 14) %}
<panel header="**Week {{ i }}**">
<include src="../schedule/week{{ i }}/admin-tic2002-fragment.md#project" />
</panel>
{% endfor %}
</div>

<div id="final-submission-info">

### Week 13: Final submission

**Deadline**: <span class="text-danger">{{ get_date(date_w13_start, 6, format=format_normal) }}</span> (Sunday of week 13)

* An extra week can be given (upon request) for a small late submission penalty of `-2` marks.
* Submissions later than the above one-week extra time are liable to a late submission penalty, to be fair to those who submitted on time. But given you are part-time students, late submission penalty will be more lenient than otherwise (e.g., `-1 per day`) and will be on a case-by-case basis.


****Deliverables****:

<box type="important" seamless>

Please upload items 2, 3, 4 as three separate files, using the three Canvas assignments provided. ==Do not put them into a single zip file==.
</box>

1. **Source code** of the working program: push to your GitHub repo.
1. **Product**:<br>
    i\. Create a JAR file for the final version of the code.<br>
    ii\. Copy it to an empty folder outside your project folder, and test it (reason: to ensure the JAR file does not depend on a specific folder location for it to work).<br>
    iii\. Submit to Canvas, name: `{YourName}.jar` e.g., `JunHao.jar`
1. **Project report**: a single .docx (preferred) or a pdf file that ==follows the template file given== (available in Canvas/Files/Handouts).
   * Submission: Upload to Canvas. The file name should be your name e.g., `JunHao.docx`
   * [Optional] Feedback for an early draft of the project report:  Optionally, you can get prof's feedback on an early draft of the project report if you email a draft of the report to the prof <span class="text-danger">no later than {{ get_date(date_w13_start, 2, format=format_normal) }}</span> (Wednesday of week 13). Note that feedback on project report draft will be high-level feedback only, and will be given only once (reason: the report is graded).
1. **Demo video**:
   * Record a demo video showcasing the features of your product.<br>
     You can use any screen recording software for this. One simple way is to start a Zoom meeting and record the meeting while screen-sharing your demo.
   * Use the exact version of the code you submitted (i.e., the demo should match the submitted code exactly).
   * Recommended length 7 minutes, max length 10 minutes.
   * Audio narration is optional if the demo can be understood without the audio.
   * Ensure the video is in a format that can be played by any computer.
   * Submission: Name the file with your name (to match the jar and the report file) and upload to Canvas.
1. **Code Reuse Declaration**:
   * Submit the 'Code Reuse Declaration' survey (on Canvas) when it opens in week 13, to declare your level of code reuse in the project.
   * This is compulsory. You <span class="text-danger">must submit this even if you did not reuse</span> any code.

# Policies

<div id="deadlines-info">

### Deadlines
* Deadline for weekly tasks:
  * **If a specific deadline is given**, adhere to that.
  * **If no specific deadline is given**, try to complete tasks allocated to a week by Tuesday 6.30pm of the following week (i.e., before the next lecture). In case you fail to meet that deadline, you should still do those tasks as soon as possible. There will be no penalty if a task is done within a _grace period_ of one week after the deadline.

<div id="plagiarism-policy">

### Plagiarism

* You are allowed (and even encouraged) to discuss course tasks with others and help (and learn-from) each other. However, the submitted work should be largely your own.

# Assessment
<div class="indented">

****[{{ 100 - (marks_exam | int) }}%] CA****
* **{{ marks_participation }}%: Participation** -- Each week has activities that can earn you participation points.<br>
  For you to be considered as _participated_ in a particular week, you need to earn at least half of available participation points in that week (e.g., if the eligible activities in a week offer a total of `5` points, you should earn at least `3` points).<br>
  To earn full {{ marks_participation }}% marks allocated for participation, you should have _participated_ (based on the above criterion) in at least 10 (out of 13) weeks.<br>
  You can track your participation points through the [Participation Dashboard]({{ url_participation_dashboard }}).<br>
  Given below are the typical activities that can earn you participation points:
  * **Weekly quizzes**:
    * When awarding participation points for quizzes, we look for two conditions:
      * Condition 1: submitted **_early_** i.e., before the next lecture
      * Condition 2: answered **_correctly_** i.e., least 70% of the answers are correct %%(reason: to discourage random answers)%%
    * You earn:
      * 3 points if you satisfy both conditions.
      * 2 points if only one of the conditions is satisfied.
      * 1 point if submitted but both conditions are not satisfied.
  * **Weekly programming exercises**: You can earn `3` points if you complete at least 80% of the exercises allocated for that week.
  * **Other admin activities**: Other admin activities such as submitting a survey can earn you `2` points, unless the activity specify a different number of points.
* **[{{ marks_ip }}%] Project**
  * **[{{ marks_ip_implementation }}%]** Features, code
  * **[{{ marks_ip_documentation }}%]** Documentation

****[{{ marks_exam }}%] Final Exam****
