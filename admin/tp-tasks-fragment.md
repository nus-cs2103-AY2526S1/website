<box type="warning" seamless>

**The goal of freezing features in the pre-release iteration is to minimize latent bugs** by avoiding behavior changes unless they are strictly necessary, so that we minimize the possibility of introducing more bugs.<br>
In a real project, minor or critical changes might be allowed even near a deadline -- but in the tP, it is hard to enforce such a rule objectively. Instead, we enforce a quantitative limit that is easier to enforce: <span class="text-danger">**no more than 10% or 50 LoC (whichever is higher) of the functional code is allowed to be changed during the iteration {{ version_final }}**</span>.<br>
Finer details of this limit are given below (**also see [Q0] and [Q1]** given under FAQs):

* **The feature freeze ==starts at 10am on the PE-D day==.** Any code updated after that deadlines is counted against the feature freeze.
* **The limit is applied per member**. That is, we compare the amount of code attributed to each member (as per the tP code dashboard) against the portion of that code that was changed during the feature freeze. Any penalty for violating the feature freeze will be applied to that member only.
* **The limit applies to functional code only** i.e., changes to files inside the `src\main` folder and sub-folders. The feature freeze doesn't apply to test code, documentation, or non-code files (e.g., images).
* **The calculation is based on the [tP code dashboard]({{ url_tp_dashboard }})**, as 'of the total functional LoC attributed to you at the end of `{{ version_final }}`, what percentage was edited by you during the feature freeze?'.
* **The penalty for violating the feature freeze will be case-by-case basis**, but not smaller than `-2`.
* **We will allow 5% a margin-of-error on top of the 10%** -- so, you will not be penalised if you exceed 10% by a tiny bit (i.e., up to 15%).
* **There is no limit on the nature of changes you can do** to functional code, but we **strongly recommend to choose based on,**<br>
  a) the **priority** (i.e., how important the change is), and,<br>
  b) the **risk** (i.e., the risk of the change introducing new bugs).

**Using 'Planned Enhancements' DG section to counter known feature flaws:** Given you are not allowed to update functional code freely in {{ version_final }}, we allow you to optionally add a section named `Appendix: Planned Enhancements` to the end of the DG. More details in the panel below:

{{ embed_topic("tp-deliverables-dg-fragment.md#planned-enhancements-info", "Admin " + icon_embedding + " tP → Deliverables → DG (extract): Planned Enhancements", "3", indent="1") }}

****FAQs on the feature freeze:****

<panel type="seamless" header="**==[Q0]==** **How exactly is the LoC limit calculated**?" minimal>

**A:** The calculation is based on your LoC at the end of the `{{ version_final }}`, not the current LoC.

Example: Suppose you currently have `600 LoC` under your name. At the end of the `{{ version_final }}` you ended up with,

* `650 LoC` %%(you added some code, and edited some other code)%%:<br>
  → Of that `650 LoC`, you could have added/edited up to `650 * 10% = 65 LoC` during the feature freeze.
* `550 LoC` %%(lower than you started with because you deleted some code)%%:<br>
  → Of that `550 LoC`, you could have added/edited up to `550 * 10% = 55 LoC` during the feature freeze.
* `400 LoC` %%(because you deleted a lot of code)%%:<br>
  → `400 * 10% = 40 LoC` is less than `50 LoC`. You could have added/edited up to `50 Loc` of that `400 LoC`.

So, **deleting lines does not count as a change** (only editing and adding are counted as changes) but deleting lines reduces the number of LoC attributed to you, and hence, reduces the number of lines you can change during the feature freeze.
</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**==[Q1]==** How can a student **calculate/track how much code s/he can change**?" minimal>

**A:** Keep in mind that the calculation is based on your LoC at the end of the `{{ version_final }}`, not the current LoC (the current LoC can still provide a rough estimate). You may use the following two code dashboards to find the current functional code LoC attributed to you:

* [**tP Code Dashboard (Functional Code Only)**]({{ url_tp_dashboard_fc_only }}) -- this is the normal tP code dashboard, but configured to show functional code changes only.
* [**tP Code Dashboard (Feature Freeze Period Only)**]({{ url_tp_feature_freeze_dashboard }}) -- this shows changes to functional code during the feature freeze period only.<br>
  Caveat: This dashboard shows code changes from Week 11 Saturday onwards, not from Friday 10am %%(reason: RepoSense does not support setting the start to a specific time)%%. So, it will not show code changes you did in the Friday 10am to midnight. If you did some code changes during that period, you need to factor that in manually.

The above two dashboard links are also available in the top navigation menu of the course website (see under `Project Links`).

Both code dashboards are currently set to auto-update every three hours.
</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**[Q2]** Suppose fixing a bug will violate the feature freeze but not fixing it can incur a penalty during the PE. How do we decide **which option is less costly**?" minimal>

**A:** No single bug can incur a penalty of more than `-2`, which is the minimum penalty for violating the feature freeze.

Product design is hard, and achieving a very good design takes experience, skill, and multiple iterative refinements. Hence, having some bugs at this stage is natural. Accordingly, bugs will not be penalized in the following cases:

* If it is a feature flaw that will be fixed by an item you listed in the _Planned enhancements_ DG section (as mentioned above).
* After the bug is reported during the PE, you successfully argued it as 'not in scope' (i.e., fixing it is of lower priority than the work done already, and hence it is justifiable to be postponed to a future version). Reporters of such bugs will earn partial credit.

In addition, you can mitigate the impact of such bugs and thus lower its severity by tweaking the UG (e.g., explain the feature better, clearly state the limitations and guide users to work around those limitations).
</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**[Q3]** Are **minor/cosmetic code refactoring** counted against the feature freeze?" minimal>

**A:** Yes, all changes are counted. If Git sees the line as 'modified', it will be counted as a changed line.
</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**[Q4]** Change percentage is counted using **all lines or non-blank lines only**?" minimal>

**A:** For simplicity, we'll be using all lines.
</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**[Q5]** Can we **squeeze in more changes into the feature freeze** by 'clever hacks' (e.g., combining multiple lines etc.)?" minimal>

**A:** All cases of changes near to the limit will be examined manually. If we notice any such attempts to 'game the system', they will be penalized accordingly.
</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**[Q6]** Can I **borrow the unused 'change quota'** of another member?" minimal>

**A:** No. But there is no restriction against one member helping to fix a feature of another member.

</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**[Q7]** Can we **add entirely new features** during the feature freeze?" minimal>

**A:** This is strongly discouraged as it goes against the spirit of the feature freeze. That said, we enforce the feature freeze based only on the _amount_ of code changed, not the _nature_ of the code change.

</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**[Q8]** We already merged a PR that violates the feature freeze. Now what?" minimal>

**A:** No penalty if you revert the change for the final submission. You can use [GitHub's _Revert PR_ feature](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/reverting-a-pull-request) for this. Failing that, you'll need to reverse the merge commit of the offending PR manually, or at least do another PR to reverse the effect of the previous feature freeze violation.
</panel>

<panel type="seamless" header="**[Q9]** How to decide between recording a feature flaw as a 'known issue' (in the UG) and a 'planned enhancement' (in the DG)?" minimal>

**A:**

* UG's 'Known Issues' is a way to caution users about limitations of the app. In terms of grading, informing users of an issue can reduce the severity of the issue, but they are not totally immune from being reported/penalized as bugs.<br>
  DG's 'Planned Enhancements' are immune from PE bug reporting. It's mostly for PE purposes (i.e., a course-specific item); not something you see often in real DGs.
* There is no limit to how many known issues you can list in the UG, but listing many will put the product in a negative light.
* You can list the same item in both, in which case the presentation/details of it can vary between the two too (as the two documents are meant for two different audiences).

++**Connecting the dots so far ...**++{.text-info}

* **We already know that the tP will be done in breadth-first iterative manner**, each iteration delivering a working version that will be evolved further by subsequent iterations. Now is a good time for us to plan those iterations.{ texts="['A.','B.','C.','D.']" t-class="fw-bold text-info" }
* **Intuitively, it feels like we should decide features of the final version first**, and then, work our way backwards to plan intermediate versions.<br>
  **But that approach is not advisable, due to the difficulty of reliably estimating the effort** each feature will need, _especially because you are not experienced in doing similar projects_. So, any such long-range plan is likely to be highly inaccurate anyway.
* **Instead, our approach is  to ==assume the current iteration is the last iteration.==**<br>
  Then, we aim to deliver the best possible product at the current iteration, based on available time.<br>
  We execute the iteration accordingly, and even tweak the plan further along the way, as needed.<br>
  After the iteration is over, we plan the next iteration as if _it's_ the last iteration. But that time, we can factor in the experience from the previous iteration to do a better job of planning.<br>
 **How is that better?**
  * **More practical**: Shorter-term plans have a better chance of being accurate and doable.{{ bullet_tick_green }}
  * **Planning improves over time**: You get multiple 'clean shots' at project planning. Each try can learn from the previous tries. Hence, more learning.
  * **Lower risk**: As each iteration produces a working product, you always have a working product, which practically eliminates the risk failing to deliver a working product by the final deadline.
* **However, it does not mean we simply keep adding features without any plan** and declare whatever we have at the end as the 'final product'. Instead, we should still set targets, and follow a plan that aims to hit those targets.<br>
  Thus, we can adopt the following two **P**lanning **S**trategies:
  <box type="important" id="ps1-and-ps2" seamless>

  * **We should have a clear overall _direction_**.This ensures we always head in the right direction, even if the final product is not defined precisely yet. { icon="" texts="['PS1.', 'PS2.']"  t-class="fw-bold text-danger" }
  * **An iteration should start by defining a precise target for it**, aligned with the project direction. This ensures we always have a concrete target to aim for.
  </box>

  Along PS1, we have already defined (in the previous week) the _target user profile_, and the _problem addressed_.<br>
  Along PS2, we have not done anything yet.

* The task {{ thumb_small("1") }} (_Brainstorm user stories_) takes one more step in the direction of PS1 above, by **brainstorming all the capabilities the target user might want the final product to provide**.<br>
  Note: We are not aiming for a precise design of the final end product. As per B, we don't need such a precise design this early in the project.
* The task {{ thumb_small("2") }} (_Choose user stories for the MVP version_) takes the first step in the direction of PS2 above, by **narrowing down the user requirements** to a smaller subset that we can deliver in an earlier iteration.

++**Connecting the dots so far ...**++{.text-info}

Previously, we mentioned the following two project planning strategies:
<blockquote>

<include src="tp-tasks-fragment.md#ps1-and-ps2" />
</blockquote>

Last week,
* to help with PS1, we collected potential user stories for the final product.
* to help with PS2, we selected a subset of those user stories for an MVP version of the product.


++**What's happening this week:**++{.text-info}

{{ show_tp_iterations_gantt("tpGanttChart-preIterations.png", 800, 77, 80) }}

This week, we focus on two fronts:

* **The first front (which aligns with PS2) moves towards defining a precise target for the first version** (i.e., MVP): task {{ thumb_small("1") }} translates the selected user stories into a _feature list_ and task {{ thumb_small("2") }} expands that feature lists to a more precise _feature specification_.
* **On the other front, we prepare to start coding work**. Tasks {{ thumb_small("3") }} (_Set up the project repo_), and {{ thumb_small("4") }} (_Get familiar with the codebase_) help with that.


++**Things to note:**++{.text-info}

* **tP tasks progress is graded**. Completing individual and team tasks are considered for grading the _project management_ component of your project grade. That said, unless a deliverable is marked 'time-sensitive', there is no penalty for missing a deadline provided you catch up with most of them within a few days after the deadline.{{ bullet_important_red }}

If you have been using Sourcetree (or other GUI) for Git before, we strongly recommend that you ==move towards using the CLI to perform Git tasks== in the second half of the semester.

But you can continue to use your favorite Git GUI for a more 'visual' view of your repo, side-by-side with the CLI e.g., from Sourcetree, you can open a gitbash terminal, run the command in that terminal, and see the result in the GUI.

<span class="text-info">**Shocked by iP to tP transition?**</span> Around this time you will realize how the speed you can implement things in the tP is significantly slower compared to the iP. As discouraging as this might feel, there are several ways this can contribute towards the learning outcomes of this course, and it is not expected to affect your tP grade either.

<panel type="seamless" header="More on this ...">

1. **It is important to realize that working in larger codebases is a much slower affair.** The number of lines an engineer can write per day is often limited to a double-digit value, [even going as low as 20](https://medium.com/modern-stack/how-much-computer-code-has-been-written-c8c03100f459#:~:text=As%20we%20can%20see%2C%20a,in%20a%20given%20working%20year.)).
1. **The speed varies from project to project**, and naturally, is slowest at the start when you are very new to the project. Even so if you are new to working with legacy code. On the positive side, the iterative approach we use gives us room to adjust targets based on the actual speed you can deliver in the tP codebase.
1. **The slowness of progress can be partly due to design flaws** of the current codebase (i.e., the design makes code changes harder than necessary). Keep a lookout for such cases, and if you can think of design tweaks that makes the code easier to change, go ahead and try them out. Such work can earn credit too.

Finally, we don't expect each of you to put into the tP more _effort_ than you put into the iP (i.e., as the progress in the tP is expected to be slower, it is not necessarily write as much code or implement as many features as you did in the iP). Keep in mind the tP had been done by thousands of students before, and we are well aware that the amount of new features that you can deliver in the tP is not much. So, the slow progress will not affect your tP grade, as that is already factored into the grading. **What is needed is for you to recalibrate your own tP expectations/plans to match the reality of the tP environment** -- such recalibration is a learning outcome of the course too.

**Iteration vs milestone vs version:**{.text-info}

**An _iteration_ can aim to reach zero or more _milestones_, some of which can be the release of a product _version_**. So, they are three different things.<br>
 For convenience, the tP uses a version number to refer to all three. For example, when we say _iteration `{{ version_mvp }}`_, we mean _the iteration that ends in the milestone `{{ version_mvp }}` (that also happens to deliver the product version `{{ version_mvp }}`)_.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**How to define version numbers?**{.text-info}

While there is no universal set of rules on choosing version numbers for a product, **there is a convention named [SemVer](https://semver.org/) that is well-defined and widely used**. Our tP version numbers (`{{ version_mvp }}`, `{{ version_penultimate }}`, `{{ version_final }}` etc.) do not follow SemVer strictly though.
</box>

This is your first 'proper' iteration that delivers a product. Ensure you ==remember how you are expected to 'manage' an iteration== (graded), given in the panel below:

We call this the _alpha version_ because **this version is meant to be good enough for <tooltip content="testing done by internal testers">_alpha testing_</tooltip>** of the product.

First, %%in task {{ thumb_small("1")}}%% we look back at the previous iteration, to see what we can learn from it.<br>
Then, %%in {{ thumb_small("2")}}%% we plan features to be implemented in this version, while aiming to come very close to the final product's feature set.<br>

Ideally, the tP work should be distributed equally across all tP works. In practice though, this can be uneven based on your other commitments %%e.g., most did less work in week 7-8 due to midterm exams%%.

==If you were to pick one tP week to push the hardest, this week should be it!== That is because in this iteration you need to implement all features that you plan to include in the final version (but they need not be fully polished).

<div id="desc_get_familiar_with_ab3">

* **Objectives:** (1) To get each of you to think of ways to improve AB3 (2) To detect any Java version compatibility issues between your local set up and the expected Java version.

* **Submission:** via [Canvas survey named `tP: AB3 Initial Experience`]({{ url_canvas_home }}/quizzes) by ==<span class="text-danger">{{ get_date(date_w3_start, 5, time="23:59") }}</span>==

* **Steps:**
    1. Download the latest released version %%(i.e., the jar file)%% of AB3 from [its upstream repo](https://se-edu.github.io/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html).
    1. Get it running on your computer. Play around with it to familiarize yourself with its current features.
    1. Add yourself to the list of contacts in AB3 (using the `add ...` command).
    1. Take a screenshot of the AB3 Window, while it shows your own contact info you added earlier. Save it as a `.png` file.
    1. Think about how the AB3 user experience can be improved, for example, by tweaking the command format, or the GUI, or the features. Note them down as a list of feature suggestions, as free text (i.e., no specific format).<br>
       Suggested: Try to come up with at least 5 ways to improve AB3, while also trying to go beyond the simple/obvious ones (i.e., this is a chance to be insightful but also creative).<br>
       Also keep the following tP constraints/recommendations in mind when doing this, as improvements that are not aligned with [tP constraints](tp-constraints.html) are unlikely to be useful later.

  **Keep records of all intermediate steps e.g., the persona, scope, narrative.**

* **User stories for what version?** At this stage, collect user stories to cover at least the final version you hope to deliver at the end of the semester. It is OK to go even beyond that %%(reason: we are simulating a project that will continue even after the semester is over)%%.{% if cs2103 %}<br>
  Do not omit user stories already covered by the features in AB3 %%i.e., the user story should be recorded even if AB3 already caters for it.%%{% endif %}

* **How many user stories?** Aim to collect more user stories than you can deliver in the project. %%Aim to create at least 30 user stories. Include all 'obvious' ones you can think of but also look for 'non-obvious' ones that you think are likely to be missed by other competing products.%%

* **User stories of what size?** Normally, it is fine to use _epic_-level user stories in the early stages of a project but given this is a small project, you may want to eventually break them down to smaller user stories (i.e., small enough for one person to implement in 1-2 days). Some examples (from the iP product domain):
  * {{ bad }} As a user, I can track my schedule, so that I can know when to do things.<br>
    %%Reason: too big, as _track_ can involve a lot of things.%%
  * {{ good }} As a user, I can add a time to a task, so that I can record when a task need to be done.
  * {{ good }} As a user, I can see the pending task that has the next earliest deadline, so that I can know what I need to do next.<br><br>

* **What format?**: You may use a sentence format or a table format but do maintain the prescribed three-part structure of a user story. In particular, ==try to include the _benefit_ part in most user stories== as that will come in handy when prioritizing user stories later.<br>
  {{ icon_tip }} **Use an online spreadsheet for recording user stories** (e.g., Google Sheets), if you are not sure which tool to use. -- they are easy to edit, share, color, and more importantly, sort/filter.

* **Submission** (to be checked by the tutor later):<br>
  * **Intermediate steps** (e.g., persona, narrative): These should be in your collaborative project document started in the previous week. Mark them clearly so that the tutor can detect them easily.
  * **Brainstormed user stories**:  Record them using an <!--~~write each user story in a piece of paper (e.g., yellow sticky note, index card, or just pieces of paper about the size of a playing card).

* **In the interest of keeping the MVP small, you can narrow the scope of MVP further** e.g., narrower target user, a smaller value proposition.

* **Suggested workflow:**
  1. **First stage**:
     * Divide the user stories among team members.
     * Each member will go through their user stories to discard (e.g., cross out, or move to a different location, but not delete) which are _definitely not needed_ for MVP.
  1. **Second stage**:
     * All members discuss the remaining user stories (i.e., the ones not discarded in the first stage), and try to trim the list further.

<box type="info" icon=":fas-clock:" seamless>

==Ideally, you should do this task in this week==, but you may take an extra week (i.e., by week 7) to finish.
</box>

* Do the following tutorials to get familiar with the codebase
<div class="indented-level2">

<panel type="info" header="Tutorial 1 - Tracing a Command Execution Path" expanded>

See [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3TracingCode.html) for details.

We recommend that you put in a sincere effort into this tutorial because tracing through the code of an unfamiliar codebase is an important skill that you can learn by doing so; you will not be able to learn/practice later in the project as the code will no longer be 'unfamiliar' to you later.

**Submission** [optional]: Post an issue in your team's repo with the title `Tutorial: tracing code`. In the description, add a 2-3 screenshots you took while at various points of the tutorial. You may close the issue soon after.
</panel>
<panel type="info" header="Tutorial 2 - Adding a new Command" expanded>

See [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/ab3AddRemark.html) for details.

If you are an experienced programmer, you can add a different command than the one given in the tutorial.

**Submission:** Do your changes in a branch named `tutorial-adding-command`, push to your fork, and create a PR from your fork's `tutorial-adding-command` branch to your team repo's `master` branch. You may close the PR soon after (i.e., no need to merge the PR).

* **Why?**: So far, we have user stories we want to include in the MVP version. But user stories simply tell us _user needs_. To move towards a product design, we need to design _features_ of the product that can fulfill those user needs.

* Draft a user guide in a convenient medium (e.g., a GoogleDoc) to describe what the product would be like when it is at {{ version_mvp }}.
  * We recommend that you follow the [AB3 User Guide]({{ url_ab3_upstream_website }}/UserGuide.html) in terms of structure and format.

  While the UG draft need not be 'polished', it should be detailed enough to tell the user how to use the product features in concern.
  * IMPORTANT:
    * Specify the precise/full command syntax for the CLI commands that you will deliver at {{ version_mvp }}.
      i.e., we want you to know exactly what you plan to deliver at {{ version_mvp }} -- while it is fine to change this plan later, it is still important to have a plan first.

  * Consider including examples of expected outputs too.

<div tags="m--cs2103">

* **Deadline:** Recommended to finish by the regular weekly project deadline (i.e., before the next {{ lecture_name }}), but given the iP final submission is due this week, you may take until Sunday ({{ get_date(date_w6_start, 6) }}) to submit this.

* **Why?** In addition to helping towards PS2, this deliverable forces you to make some fine-grained product design decisions early, thus giving you a better idea about the complexities that lie ahead, and hence, a better sense of the effort that will be required.

* ****Task:**** **Collate into a document the _complete_ detailed description of the intended behavior of the MVP version of the product.**
  * The intended audience for this document is team members, not users (i.e., this is not a user guide).
  * Use a medium that is convenient for collaboration (e.g., a GoogleDoc).
  * The content need not be polished. Don't waste time in formatting, copy editing etc.
  * **For each feature, specify #r#all## of the following:**

<div class="indented-level2">
<box>

* **Feature**: Name of the feature %%e.g., Add contact%% {{ bullet_checkbox_selected_green }}
* **Purpose**: What it does<br><br>
* **Command format**: The precise command format of the command.
* **Example commands**: %%(to show how the command is used)%%<br><br>
* **For each parameter**, specify the following.<br>
  Yes, making these decisions is not easy -- and that's why we want you to think about them now rather than later. Feel free to discuss these validation rules in the forum.<br>
  * Acceptable values %%e.g., If a command takes a person name as a parameter, what inputs are accepted as valid person names?%% Some example aspect to consider:
    * Which formats are allowed for dates, times, telephone numbers, etc.?
    * How does extra/leading/trailing spaces affect the value -- for instance is 'John Doe' same as 'John&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doe' (note the multiple spaces in the middle of the name)?
    * How does UPPER/lower case affects values -- is `John Doe` same as `john doe`?
    * It's not enough to state 'valid name'; you need to specify what rules will be used to determine if the input is a valid name.
  * Error message if the value is not acceptable
  * Rationale for the validity rule %%e.g., why only certain characters are allowed for person names?%%<br><br>
* **Outputs**: Precise expected outputs when the command,
  * succeeds %%e.g., changes in the GUI, messages shown to the user%%
  * fails %%e.g., what are the error messages shown when a specific parameter is invalid, missing, specified multiple times, etc.%%
* **Duplicate handling:** What rules are used to determine if two contacts are duplicates? %%e.g., is having the same name enough for two contacts to be considered duplicates, or all details need to be the same?%%<br>
How does the application react to such duplicate entries? Reject or accept? Why?
* **Possible errors:** A list of potential errors related to the feature (excluding the ones mentioned above already) %%e.g., editing a contact in a way that it becomes inconsistent with the rest of the data%%, and how the app responds to each error %%e.g., the error message%%.
* **Relevant UI mock-ups** (unless the UI will be exactly the same as AB3, in which case you should use AB3 screenshots in place of UI mock-ups): %%they can be hand-drawn or created using a tool such as PowerPoint, PlantUML, Figma, etc. -- they can be very low-fidelity mock-ups, as they are meant to be temporary%%

---

{{ icon_tip }} **Recommended: Decide priorities of finer aspects of features**, for example, as must-have (to implement in the MVP) and nice-to-have (i.e., to implement in the MVP only if there is time)<br>
   %%e.g., you can decide one date format that is to be supported in user commands as must-have and two other formats as nice-to-have.%%
</box>
</div>

* **What features should be in the MVP?** In our context, the MVP is considered as the must-have features of your product, for the intended target audience. That is, the product is _impossible_ (not merely inconvenient) to use without those features. %%For example, a product is impossible to use without an 'add' feature but can be used without a 'edit' feature (because deleting and re-adding can be used in place of editing).%%

* **It is OK to make compromises** when making product decisions -- every design option has costs and benefits, and sometimes, costs outweigh the benefits.<br>
For example, it is fine to restrict the person name to a certain length and a character set even if it is theoretically possible for those restrictions to conflict with some rare real-world person names. But you need to be aware of such conflicts, justify the restriction (e.g., ease of implementation/display), and know how users can work around such a conflict should they encounter it %%(e.g., if you app doesn't allow two contacts to have the same name but the user need to store two contacts which are different people with the same name, what should the user do?)%%.

* **You are welcome to (but not required to) follow AB3** when defining the behavior of the new features %%e.g., use similar command formats, input validation rules, error message formats%%.<br>

{{ show_faq("tpAb3FeatureInMvpSpec", is_compact=1) if cs2103 }}
{{ show_faq("tpNeedForNewFeatureInMvp") if cs2103 }}

* **Ensure feature-fit**: While doing this, ensure the features written by each member fit together to form a cohesive product, and meet other grading criteria of the _product design_ aspect. This might require several rounds of refinement. You are encouraged to peer-review feature details written by other team members and refine the overall product design together.

{{ embed_topic("tp-grading.md#criteria-productDesign", "Admin " + icon_embedding + " **tP: Grading → Product Design**", "3", indent="1") }}

* {{ icon_important_big_red }} **Submission** [one person per team]: Save the file as a PDF file, name it `{team-id}.pdf` e.g., `{{ example_team_id }}.pdf`, and upload to Canvas.
* **Grading criteria**: to be considered 'done', the feature spec. should meet all the following criteria:
  * Covers all features in the smallest set of features the product cannot do without.
  * Contains all details mentioned above for each of those features
  * Details seem well-thought-out (i.e., not a half-hearted attempt to satisfy the expected level of details)

Now that you have learned the tP workflow, you can proceed to updating a few more tP documents, as per tasks ****A**** and ****B**** below, following the same workflow (optional to do parallel PRs though).

<box type="info" light>

**Recommended procedure for updating docs**:{.text-info}

1. Decide among yourselves who will update which parts of the document(s).<br>
   All team members are expected to contribute to all aspects of documentation %%(e.g., user docs, developer docs, diagrams)%%
1. Update the team repo by following the prescribed workflow:

{{ embed_topic("appendixE-gitHub.md#tp-schedule-tracking", "Admin " + icon_embedding + " Appendix E(extract): **tP project schedule tracking**", "3") }}
<p/>

**Guidance on using documentation tools** (e.g., How to preview changes locally before committing/pushing) can be found in the relevant section of the Developer Guide of your team project website that you set up earlier. Given below is a shortcut, for your convenience:

* If your project is using **Jekyll** for documentation, refer [this Jekyll Guide @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html#:~:text=github.io/myrepo-,Updating%20documents,-Jekyll%20uses%20kramdown).
* If your project is using **Markbind** for documentation, refer [this MarkBind Guide @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/markbind-forked-sites.html#:~:text=latest%20%2D%2Dsave%2Ddev-,Updating%20documents,-MarkBind%20is%20a).

****A: Update README page to match your project:****

* Add a UI mockup of your intended final product.
    Note that the ==image of the UI should be `docs/images/Ui.png`== so that it can be downloaded by our scripts. Limit the file to contain one screenshot/mockup only and ensure the new image is roughly the same `height x width` proportions as the original one. %%Reason: when we compile these images from all teams into one page ([example]({{ url_team_list }})), yours should not look out of place.%%<br>
    {{ info }} The UI mock up can be a hand-drawn sketch or created using a tool such as PowerPoint, PlantUML, Figma, etc. Don't spend a lot of time on this, as this will eventually be replaced by a screenshot of the actual product.<br>
    {{ icon_Q }} Can we use an AB3 screenshot for this? Only in the unlikely case that your final product UI is expected to look exactly the same as AB3.{ texts="['A1.', 'A2.', 'A3.', 'A4.']" }
* Update the link of the GitHub Actions _build status badge_ (<img src="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/workflows/Java%20CI/badge.svg" alt="Build Status">) so that it reflects the build status of your team repo.
* Acknowledge the original source of the code e.g.,<br>
    `This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).`
* Update all remaining contents of the page to match your own project.

<box type="tip" seamless>

If you did the above updates correctly, your UI mock up and profile photos should appear in your project website and this [**Project List Page**]({{ url_team_list }}).
</box>

****B: Also update site-wide settings****, as necessary:

* You need to update the `AB-3` in the top navigation bar of your project website (it's in `docs/_config.yml` and `docs/_sass/minima/_base.scss` if using Jekyll; in `docs/_markbind/layouts/default.md` if using MarkBind).<br>

* More info on updating site-wide settings such as the above:
  * If using Jekyll: follow [the Jekyll Guide @SE-EDU/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html#:~:text=the%20final%20outcome.-,Site%2Dwide%20settings,-Typically%2C%20the%20_config).<br>

****Steps:****

* {{ icon_individual }} **Select a code change to implement**, as follows:{text="S1." t-class="fw-bold"}
  * Consider the feature that you have been assigned to implement for the upcoming MVP version of the product (which will be released by the iteration `{{ version_mvp }}`, not by the current iteration `{{ version_first }}`).
  * Pick a small code change that you'll need to do to implement that feature. This is a small code change contributing towards the feature, not the entire feature itself. %%Examples: add parser support for a new command word, add a field to the person class%%.<br>
   This code change should not 'break' the code base though (e.g., it should not refer to a class that you plan to add in a future PR but doesn't exist yet). Ideally, it should not cause any existing tests to break either. That is, the change should take the codebase forward in a meaningful way.
* {{ icon_individual }} **Implement that code change while following the workflow** that you practiced in the previous week. A summary of the steps:{text="S2."}
    * Create an issue for it. Assign it to yourself. Assign it to milestone `{{ version_first }}`.
    * Create a PR from a separate branch in your fork. Assign it to `{{ version_first }}`.
    * Get the PR reviewed.
    * Get the PR merged. Close the corresponding issue.
* {{ icon_individual }} **Continue to implement more code changes** (i.e., repeat S1 and S2) to implement more code changes that move you towards your MVP feature(s). Recommended to create <tooltip content="i.e., while waiting for one PR to be merged, create a new PR to fix another issue">parallel PRs</tooltip>, when implementing code changes with no/low dependency between them.{text="S3."}
* {{ icon_team }} **Wrap up the milestone** When the iteration period is over, do the following:{text="S4."}
  * Move any pending issues/PRs to the next milestone (i.e., `{{ version_mvp }}`). %%As you do not need to release a product version at the end of this iteration, we can freely move any pending work to the next iteration.%%
  * Close the milestone.
  * There is no need to do a product release.

* **Decide the scope:** Start by deciding what features you would include in the final product !!if you had only one more week to deliver!! them. In this iteration, aim to deliver at least a <popover content="i.e., the feature is working and accessible to users, although it might not handle all the corner cases, and the UI/UX might not be fully polished yet">fully-fledged (albeit not-yet-polished)</popover> version of those features.<br>
  **:thinking: What's the hurry to add _all_ features right now?** We will be enforcing a strict _feature freeze_ at the end of `{{ version_penultimate }}` (more details in the panel below). Given you also need time to polish the features before the feature freeze starts (during which code changes will be severely restricted), it makes sense to finish the bulk of the feature implementation in this iteration (`{{ version_alpha }}`), so that you have time to test and polish it in `{{ version_penultimate }}`.

##### {{ icon_tip }} Ways to level up your tP game:{.text-success}

1. <span class="text-success">**Use parallel PRs:**</span> We encourage you to try sending parallel PRs (i.e., send another PR while the previous PR you sent is waiting to be merged) if you haven't done that yet.<br>
   Reason: It's important to learn how to do that, because in most real projects it is common to have ==multiple open PRs from the **same author**==.<br>
   {{ icon_important_big_red }} We require each student to have parallel PRs at least once during the tP %%so that we can confirm you are able to handle parallel PRs%%.
1. **Maintain the defensiveness of the code:**{.text-success} Use assertions, exceptions, and logging in your code, as well as other defensive programming measures (refer this week's topic on _defensive programming_ for more details) when appropriate. This will be considered when grading your tP code quality.<br>
   Remember to [enable assertions in your IDEA run configurations](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijUsefulSettings.html) and [in the gradle file](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html#enabling-assertions).

%%**{{ icon_info }} Some background:** As you know, our <tooltip content="i.e., Practical Exam">PE</tooltip> includes peer-testing tP products under exam conditions. At the beginning, we used GitHub as the platform for that -- which was not optimal (e.g., it was hard to ensure the compulsory labels have been applied).

We still use GitHub to record bugs reported in the PE but CATcher acts as a layer between you and GitHub, to ensure the bugs you report meet PE requirements.%%
</box>

This week, we would like you to smoke-test the CATcher app **to ensure it can work with your OS, Browser, GitHub account**, by following the steps given in the panel below.
<p/>

<panel type="info" header="**Steps for smoke-testing CATcher:**" peek>

1. **Go to the CATcher Web version** at https://catcher-org.github.io/CATcher/ using ==the same computer (i.e., not a mobile device) that you plan to use for the practical exam==.
   * Use a common browser such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
   * Allow popups from https://catcher-org.github.io/
   * If you encounter other problems at the app launch, refer to the [Notes on using CATcher](https://catcher-org.github.io/ug/).
1. **Login**: Choose the _session_ `{{ course_pair }} Smoke Test`, and submit.
   <pic eager src="images/catcherLogin.png"></pic>
1. In the next screen, login to CATcher using your GitHub account.<br>
   If the app asks for public repo access permissions, grant it (just go with the default settings).
1. **Let CATcher create a repo named `catcher-smoke-test`** in your GitHub account, when it asks for permission. That repo will be used to hold the bug reports you will create in this testing session.
1. **Use CATcher (not the GitHub Web/Mobile interface) to create 1-2 <tooltip content="i.e., bug reports containing some random content">dummy bug reports</tooltip>**. The steps are similar to how you would enter bug reports in the GitHub issue tracker. Include at least one screenshot in one of those bug reports.<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} you can ==copy-paste screenshots== into the bug description.<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} You can use Markdown syntax in the bug descriptions.<br>
   {{ icon_info }} The `severity` and `type` labels are compulsory.
1. **If you encounter any problems while using CATcher**, report them at the [CATcher issue tracker](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues).
1. **Do NOT delete the `catcher-smoke-test` repo** created by CATcher in your GitHub account (keep it until the end of the semester) as our scripts will look for it later to check if you have done this activity.

   * ==Apply the `alpha-bug` label== to the bug report, as our grading scripts will look for it when assessing your contribution level for this task.
   * {{ icon_important_big_red }} For this individual tP tasks to be marked as done, you need to submit at least 5 issues labelled `alpha-bug` %%i.e., If someone submit 5 alpha bugs, it is marked as 'done' for that person (irrespective of how many alpha-bugs other team members submit)%%.

* If your app references date/time of the computer it is running on (e.g., to calculate time elapsed), test if it can work if the computer date/time is configured to be in different formats -- different computers might use different date formats.
* Test against all typical user mistakes %%e.g., typing two spaces instead of one%%
* If sorting is involved, verify the sorting behavior follows real world expectations %%e.g., lexicographical vs alphabetical order%%
* Input validation:
  * test valid and invalid inputs, typical and non-typical inputs
  * when a range is involved (e.g., start and end time), test for start-same-as-end and start-later-than-end cases
  * test command parameters: compulsory parameters missing, optional parameters are not given, parameters are duplicated, unexpected parameters are given, typos in parameter names, parameter names appearing inside the parameter value
* User-visible messages:
  * Are they specific enough? %%e.g., does the error message indicate what exactly is the error and how to rectify it?%%
  * Are they consistent with the UG?
  * Are they complete, and accurate?
* Clean up actions:
  * If a feature is supposed to clear/delete data, ensure all relevant data are deleted.
  * If there are multiple windows, ensure all windows are closed when the application exits.
* Does the application <popover content="good: gives an error message; bad: fails silently, crashes, corrupts data">fail gracefully</popover> when pushed beyond its limits?
* UI:
  * Does it work as expected when, used in different resolutions and display scaling settings?
  * Does it work as expected when, there are many data items, more than the display area can show at a time?
  * When a command is run, does all parts of the UI updates as expected? e.g., when an item is deleted, does that item disappear from the list of items currently shown?

  * If neither _one_ of the three has enough updates but collectively they have enough updates, you can also review all of them.
  * Failing all above, you can pick any other team(s) to review.
  * Try to give at least 4 comments in total.
  * If the PR already has reviews, you can give your own input of the existing review comments too.

* In the PR, add _review comments_ (i.e., in the {{ show_as_rounded_tab(':octicon-diff: files changed') }} tab) in the corresponding place of the code.
  * In this case, choose the {{ button('Start a review', button_style="success") }} option rather than {{ button('Add single comment') }} option.
* But ==if the 'files changed' tab is too laggy, you can add a normal comment instead== in the {{ show_as_rounded_tab(':octicon-comment-discussion: conversation') }} tab.<br>
  * In this case, enter each observation as a separate comment %%(reason: our bot will count the number of comments you have given to determine if you qualify for participation points)%%
* As you know, it is better to phrase your comments as question/doubts (e.g., `Is this format correct? Should it be ... instead?`) rather than directives (e.g., `Change this to ...`).<br>
  Where possible, use screenshots from their DG in your comments, preferably with annotations. This is particularly useful when commenting on diagrams. An example given below:<br>

<box id="caution-on-pdf-conversion" type="important" seamless>

**Don't take PDF conversion lightly:**{.text-danger} **To convert the UG/DG{% if cs2113 %}/PPP{% endif %} into PDF format**, go to the generated page in your project's github.io site and use [this technique](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/savingPdf.html) to save as a pdf file. ==Using other techniques  or not following the settings suggested in the given technique can result in issues== such as missing background colors, poor quality resolution, unnecessarily large files (the last two can be considered as bugs).

**The PDF versions of the UG/DG{% if cs2113 %}/PPP{% endif %} should be _usable_** by the target readers, even if not as neat/optimized as the Web versions. For example, margins and page breaks need not be optimized, but they should not hinder the reader either. Assume some will occasionally choose the PDF version over the Web version %%e.g, for printing, offline viewing, annotating etc.%%

**PE uses the PDF versions of UG/DG, not the Web version!**{.text-danger} Any problems in those PDF files (e.g., broken links, messed up formatting) can be reported as bugs.

**Ensure hyperlinks in the pdf files work**. ==Broken/non-working hyperlinks in the PDF files will be considered as bugs==. Again, use the conversion technique given above to ensure links in the PDF files work.

**PDF files should**,
  * **be paginated** at a reasonable page size (e.g., A4). %%Reason: single-page PDF files don't work well in some PDF viewers, and not suitable for printing either.%%
  * **allow copying text** so that readers can copy text from them %%(e.g., copy an example command from the UG)%%.

**Try the PDF conversion early**. If you do it at the last minute, you may not have time to fix any problems in the generated PDF files (such problems are more common than you think).
</box>
</div>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Side benefits for early submissions:**{.text-success} Given that _using buffers to reduce the risk of deadline overruns_ is a learning outcome of this course, we strongly encourage setting an internal submission deadline a few hours earlier than the actual deadline. As an incentive, we plan to perform some checks on early submissions and inform you if we found issues with your submission %%(e.g., incorrect file name/format)%%, thus giving you a chance to fix them before the deadline and avoid a penalty for it.
