### Session: `Prelim Peer Evaluation`

* Objective: to give you a chance to give early feedback to team members, but also, a chance to familiarize with the TEAMMATES tool.
* Submission is compulsory. However, ==ratings/responses you receive will not be considered for grading== .<br>
  Although this is done early in the project timeline, we recommend that you ==give sincere/accurate feedback== to others as much as possible.
* Held early in the semester.
* The questions in this session are similar to the `Midterm Peer Evaluation`, but has the following additional question:<br>
