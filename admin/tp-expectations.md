<h2 class="text-white bg-danger p-1">Functionality Expectations</h2>

<div tags="m--cs2103" id="functionality-expectations">

**The expected level of _functionality_ is what you could achieve if each member puts in about ==50% of the implementation effort they put into the iP==** (reason for setting it much less than 100%: even after adding the extra overheads of doing the project as a team, and working with an exising codebase, we don't want the tP to take more effort than the iP). This is the primary measure we will use when grading your tP implementation effort.<br>
Furthermore, we estimate that the above-mentioned bar is roughly _equivalent_ to **writing about 300-400 lines of functional code** (excluding testing and documentation) per person. This is a secondary ballpark measure you can keep an eye on, in conjunction with the primary measure mentioned above.

<box type="important" seamless>

  In case you happen to look at tP's of past batches (2023 and before) in order to gauge the required effort, note that the above reflects a ==drastically lower bar from those semesters==. For reference, the bar given to previous batches was 'same as iP effort' (not half), and the median LoC of functional code written by a student was about 850 LoC.

<div tags="m--cs2113">

**The expected level of _functionality_ from a team is roughly ==what you can achieve if each member contributes about the same amount of functional code as required by a <tooltip content="i.e., if all requirements were met at the _minimal_ level specified">typical iP</tooltip>==**.
</div>

==There are no extra marks for exceeding implementation _effort_ bar== stated above. Hence, _effort_ is graded on mostly an S/U basis) -- it is the _quality_ of the code that really determines the marks for _implementation_ component (more info <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:tPexpectations-implementationGrading">here</trigger>).  Try to avoid adding more features than necessary, unless you are doing it out of interest; you are better off spending more effort in improving other aspects of the project instead. As mentioned elsewhere, a functionality just the right size and of high quality will earn more marks than a functionality that is bigger (or more difficult, or more interesting/novel) but of lower quality.

In the most recent semester, more than 80% of the students did significantly more work than what was needed to earn full marks for effort. Many of them were likely under the wrong impression that doing more features will earn them more marks. Try to avoid doing the same mistake yourself.

In fact, here is the grading criterion for the individual project effort:

* <span class="badge bg-info">Expectation</span> <span class="text-info">**Contribute to the functional code of the product.**</span>
  * User-visible features are preferred, but it is not a strict requirement.:
  * **The enhancement(s) should fit with the rest of the software** (and the target user profile) and should have the consent of the team members. %%You will lose marks if you go 'rogue' and add things that don't fit with the product.%%

<div tags="m--cs2103" class="indented-level2">

<panel type="seamless" header="Some example enhancements" >

  * Add a new feature %%e.g., add the ability to view statistics%%
  * Tweak an existing features %%e.g., make the command syntax more user-friendly and closer to natural language%%
  * A redesign of the GUI %%e.g., make it work like a chat application (note: chat is a form of CLI)%%
  * A redesign of the code %%e.g., Improve the design to improve the code quality.%%

</panel><p/>
</div>

* **Recommended: Contribute to _all_ aspects of the project** e.g., write back-end code, front-end code, test code, user documentation, and developer documentation. %%Reason: If you limit yourself to certain aspects only, you could lose marks allocated for the aspects you did not do. In addition, the final exam assumes that you are familiar with all aspects of the project.%%

* **Recommended: Do _all_ the work related to your enhancement yourself.** %%Reason: If there is no clear division of who did which enhancement, it will be difficult to divide project credit (or assign responsibility for bugs detected by testers) later.%%<br>
  In other words, ==we recommend that the work to be divided primarily based on _features/enhancements_== rather than _components_. The latter has problems such as the following:<br>
 (a) Higher risk of a team member becoming a _single point of failure_ %%e.g., what if the person assigned to an important component doesn't deliver on time?%%<br>
 (b) You become _too reliant_ on other team members %%e.g., a feature can't be delivered until all members have done their part%%<br>
 (c) Hard to keep tests passing %%i.e., tests break when one component is updated without the others%%<br>
 (e) Integration become harder/riskier %%i.e., move from _continuous integration_ (safer) towards _big-bang integration_ (riskier)%%<br>
 (f) Not aligned with breadth-first iterative %%i.e., evolving components separately moves you towards depth-first iterative approach instead%%

<div tags="m--cs2103">

* **Recommended: Divide the components of the product among team members**. Notwithstanding the above, you are still recommended to divide the components of the product among team members so that each team member is _in charge_ of one or more components. While others will be modifying those components to fit their features, your role as the _in charge_ of a component is to guide others modifying that component %%(reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)%% and protect that component from degrading %%e.g., you can review others' changes to your component and suggest possible changes%%.

**:thinking: How much testing is enough?** We expect you to decide. As you learn different types of testing and what they try to achieve, you should decide how much of each type is worth having. Similarly, you can decide to what extent you want to automate tests, depending on the benefits and the effort required.<br>
There is no requirement for a minimum test coverage level. Note that in a high-end production environment you might be required to have high levels of test coverage (e.g., 90%). In this project, it can be less. ==Caveat: The weaker your tests are, the higher the risk of undetected bugs/regressions, which will cost you marks if not detected/fixed before the final submission.==

This is a non-exhaustive list; you may define additional roles.

* _Code quality_: Looks after code quality, ensures adherence to coding standards, etc.
* _Deliverables and deadlines_: Ensure project deliverables are done on time and in the right format.
* _Integration_: In charge of versioning of the code, maintaining the code repository, integrating various parts of the software to create a whole.
