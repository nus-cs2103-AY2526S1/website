## Tools: for communication

* **Send all course-related emails to `{{ course | lower }}[at]comp.nus.edu.sg`**.{% if cs2103 %}<br>
  Even if your course code is `CS2103T`, the email to use is `cs2103@...` (i.e., not `cs2103t@...`).

##### :fas-comment: Forum %%(for discussions, asking admin questions, seeking help, etc.)%%
* **The preferred channels for course-related communication is the `forum` on GitHub** ==[{{url_forum}}]({{url_forum}})== (not the Canvas forum)
* When communicating with instructors, use the forum. Use private channels (e.g., emails, private messages, face-to-face, private chat groups) only when the forum is not suitable. %%Rationale: 1. More classmates can benefit from the discussions, 2. It is also safer because the prof can monitor information you receive for accuracy%%.

## Tool: The IDE

**[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is the recommended IDE** for course-related programming work. Using an IDE is strongly recommended but is not compulsory.

Our Intellij **IDEA resources can be found at [se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/)**.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Use other IDEs at your own risk**, because,<br>
a) course materials are optimized for IntelliJ, and,<br>
b) we won't be able to help you if you run into problems while using any other IDE.

That said, we have also provided a good amount of **resources for VS Code at [se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/)**.
</box>

<box>

<span style="color:purple">**:fas-hard-hat: Preparation:**</span>
* Install the IDE on your computer. You may use the IntelliJ community edition (free) or the ultimate edition (free for students).
* If you have an older version of the IDE, we recommend updating to the latest version.

## Tool: TEAMMATES (for Peer Evaluations)

We use the [TEAMMATES](http://teammatesv4.appspot.com/) online peer evaluation system. %%TEAMMATES is a project run by NUS SoC students and used by over a million users from over 1500 universities.%%

<box>

<span style="color:purple">**:fas-hard-hat: Preparation:**</span>
When the first feedback session is open on TEAMMATES, you will receive an email from TEAMMATES. There is nothing for you to do until then.

When you do receive that email, it will contain a unique link that you can use to access TEAMMATES without logging in first. Logging in to TEAMMATES using a Google account is optional (but doing so will allow you to see all your TEAMMATES sessions in one page).

## Tool: WATcher (for monitoring tP work distribution)

You can use WATcher to see **a dashboard view of the tP work distribution** (e.g., number of issues/PRs done by each member). It can also help you **easily spot workflow oversights** (e.g., issues/PRs not assigned to a person/milestone).

**Steps to use:**

1. Go to the [tP teams list page](teamList.md). Locate your team, and click the #b#:fas-w:## icon for your team.
1. When prompted, choose to access `public repos only` and login using your GitHub account.<br>
   <pic src="images/WATcher-authorization.png" width="400" />
1. After the login is complete, you will be able to see the WATcher dashboard showing the `Currently active` milestone of your tP.<br>
   <pic src="images/WATcher-dashboard.png" width="800" /><br>
   This view shows issues/PRs relevant to the most recent/current milestone, each column showing issues/PRs assigned to a specific team member.<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} This view also helps you spot oversights. e.g., it indicates ongoing issues/PRs not assigned to any milestone as #r#:octicon-milestone: ???##.
1. You can switch the view from `Currently active` to `Contributions` to view all issues/PRs contributed by each member for the entire project.
1. The filters at the top of the dashboard can be used to tweak the view further.<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} The page URL changes to match the view, which means you can share/bookmark the current view using the current URL of your Browser.

<box type="warning" light>

WATcher is a tool created by past students, and #r#still in early preview state##.<br>
**Bugs/queries/suggestions**, please post in the [WATcher issue tracker](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/issues).
