## Tool: GitHub (for code hosting)

**You are _required to_ use GitHub** as the hosting and collaboration platform of your project (i.e., to hold the Code repository, Issue Tracker, etc.).

<box>

<span style="color:purple">**:fas-hard-hat: Preparation**:</span>

Create a GitHub account (if you don't have one yet), as explained in the panel below.

## Tool: Git (for revision control)

**You are _required to_ use Git.** The recommended GUI client for Git is [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), but you may use any other, or none.

<box>

<span style="color:purple">**:fas-hard-hat: Preparation:**</span>

**1. Install Git and a Git GUI client** on your computer.

* **Option A [recommended]: install Sourcetree (our recommended Git GUI)** which comes bundled with Git i.e., if you install Sourcetree, you get both Git and a GUI client in one shot ([installation instructions](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/sourcetree.html)).<br>
* **Option B: Install stand-alone Git**: If you are already familiar with Git and you prefer to use Git via the command line (i.e., without a GUI), you can [install standalone Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) instead.

<div id="git-username">

**2. Set Git `user.name`**: We use various tools to analyze your code. For us to be able to identify your commits, we encourage you to ==set your Git `user.name` in all computers you use== to a sensible string that uniquely identifies you. For example, ==you can set it to your GitHub username or your full name==. If this username is not set properly or if you use multiple usernames for Git, our grading scripts might miss some of your work.

After installing Git in a computer, you can set the Git username as follows:
1. Open a terminal that can run Git commands (e.g., a [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash) window, which comes with Sourcetree)
2. Run the command `git config --global user.name YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`<br>
   e.g., `git config --global user.name JohnDoe`

More info about setting Git username is [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/).

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Cautions about Git GUIs** (especially if you are new to Git):

* **Using Git GUIs other than Sourcetree** is allowed, but we are unable  to provide support if you run into any problems while using a different Git GUI.
* **Using Git (or GitHub) features that come with the IDE** is discouraged as it is better to learn Git/GitHub independent of any other tool.
* **Using clients provided by GitHub** (e.g., _GitHub Desktop_ app) is discouraged as it will make it harder for you to separate Git features from GitHub features.
* **Long-term use of a Git GUI for _all_ Git usage** is discouraged as well. Once you are over the initial learning curve, it is best to use CLI in tandem with GUI, as each mode has pros and cons. Often, the best is to perform operations using CLI and use a GUI to get a more visual view (e.g., to visually inspect the revision graph).

## Tools: for communication

##### :fas-envelope: Course email %%(for course related queries, etc.)%%

* **Send all course-related emails to `{{ course | lower }}[at]comp.nus.edu.sg`**.{% if cs2103 %}<br>
  Even if your course code is `CS2103T`, the email to use is `cs2103@...` (i.e., not `cs2103t@...`).

##### :fas-comment: Forum %%(for discussions, asking admin questions, seeking help, etc.)%%
* **The preferred channels for course-related communication is the `forum` on GitHub** ==[{{url_forum}}]({{url_forum}})== (not the Canvas forum)
* When communicating with instructors, use the forum. Use private channels (e.g., emails, private messages, face-to-face, private chat groups) only when the forum is not suitable. %%Rationale: 1. More classmates can benefit from the discussions, 2. It is also safer because the prof can monitor information you receive for accuracy%%.
<div tags="m--cs2103 m--cs2113">

## Tool: IntelliJ IDE

**[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is the recommended IDE** for course-related programming work. Using an IDE is strongly recommended but is not compulsory.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Use other IDEs at your own risk**, because,<br>
a) course materials are optimized for IntelliJ, and,<br>
b) we won't be able to help you if you run into problems while using any other IDE.
</box>

<box>

<span style="color:purple">**:fas-hard-hat: Preparation:**</span>
* Install the IDE on your computer. You may use the IntelliJ community edition (free) or the ultimate edition (free for students).
* If you have an older version of the IDE, we recommend updating to the latest version.

## Tool: WATcher (for monitoring tP work distribution)

You can use WATcher to see **a dashboard view of the tP work distribution** (e.g., number of issues/PRs done by each member). It can also help you **easily spot workflow oversights** (e.g., issues/PRs not assigned to a person/milestone).

**Steps to use:**

1. Go to the [tP teams list page](teamList.md). Locate your team, and click the #b#:fas-w:## icon for your team.
1. When prompted, choose to access `public repos only` and login using your GitHub account.<br>
   <pic src="images/WATcher-authorization.png" width="400" />
1. After the login is complete, you will be able to see the WATcher dashboard showing the `Currently active` milestone of your tP.<br>
   <pic src="images/WATcher-dashboard.png" width="800" /><br>
   This view shows issues/PRs relevant to the most recent/current milestone, each column showing issues/PRs assigned to a specific team member.<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} This view also helps you spot oversights. e.g., it indicates ongoing issues/PRs not assigned to any milestone as #r#:octicon-milestone: ???##.
1. You can switch the view from `Currently active` to `Contributions` to view all issues/PRs contributed by each member for the entire project.
1. The filters at the top of the dashboard can be used to tweak the view further.<br>
   {{ icon_tip }} The page URL changes to match the view, which means you can share/bookmark the current view using the current URL of your Browser.

WATcher is a tool created by past students, and #r#still in early preview state##.<br>
